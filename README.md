# spongebot
This is a pair of Discord bots that echo all posts made in one channel by a specific user to another channel, but with sPonGeBoB CapItAliZaTiOn. Very useful for mocking someone discreetly. 

### setup

Run `npm install` and update the `auth.json` file in both the client and server folders.

The server bot should be added to the primary server while the client should go on the secondary one. Instructions for setting up a Discord bot can be found [here]("https://github.com/reactiflux/discord-irc/wiki/Creating-a-discord-bot-&-getting-a-token").
